  - `empty_directory()`: Empties the contents of a directory.

### Main
- **Methods:**
  - `main()`: Handles command-line arguments and determines whether to process a single file or a directory of files.
  - `process_block(file_path, time_in_s=300, stream_id='well000', recnumber=0, sorting_folder=f"{BASE_FILE_PATH}/Sorting_Intermediate_files", clear_temp_files=True)`: Processes a block of data, including preprocessing, spike sorting, waveform extraction, and saving results.
  - `routine_sequential(file_path, number_of_configurations, time_in_s)`: Processes multiple recording configurations sequentially.
  - `routine_parallel(file_path, number_of_configurations, time_in_s)`: Processes multiple recording configurations in parallel using multiprocessing.

## Data Flow and Interactions

1. **Logger Setup:**
   - The `Logger` class is instantiated and configured to log messages to `application.log`.

2. **Data Handling:**
   - The `DataHandler` class reads Maxwell MEA recordings and can save them in the Zarr format.

3. **Preprocessing:**
   - The `Preprocessor` class preprocesses the data by performing bandpass filtering and common average referencing. It also retrieves channel recording statistics.

4. **Spike Sorting:**
   - The `KilosortHandler` class runs the Kilosort algorithm to detect and sort spikes. The results are retrieved from the specified output folder.

5. **Waveform Extraction and Analysis:**
   - The `WaveformHandler` class extracts waveform snippets around detected spikes and loads waveform results.
   - The `QualityMetrics` class computes quality metrics and filters out units that do not meet specific criteria.

6. **Template Analysis:**
   - The `TemplateHandler` class computes metrics related to waveform templates, identifies and merges similar templates, and removes redundant templates.

7. **Channel Analysis:**
   - The `ChannelAnalyzer` class analyzes units and their corresponding extremum channels, ensuring only unique templates are retained.

8. **Visualization:**
   - The `Visualization` class visualizes the spatial distribution of units on the MEA probe and saves waveform plots.

9. **Utilities and Helper Functions:**
   - The `Utilities` class finds connected components for identifying transitive relationships between templates.
   - The `Helper` class provides utility functions to check and empty directories.

10. **Main Execution:**
    - The `Main` class handles the command-line arguments and processes data either sequentially or in parallel. It coordinates the entire data processing pipeline, from reading the data to saving the final results.

## Conclusion

This script provides a comprehensive pipeline for MEA data analysis, from preprocessing and spike sorting to detailed waveform analysis and visualization. It utilizes advanced sorting algorithms and quality metric computations to ensure high-quality data analysis, suitable for neuroscientific research.

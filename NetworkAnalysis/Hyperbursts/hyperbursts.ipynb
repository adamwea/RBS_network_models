    "% In this tutorial, we will analyse joint activity of neurons across the chip. \n",
    "% Using a Network recording of the most active electrodes, we will detect network \n",
    "% bursts: synchronous short-term increases in firing rate of the recorded neurons, \n",
    "% followed by longer periods of reduced activity (inter-burst interval). We will \n",
    "% see how parameters can be adjusted to optimise burst detection and derive some \n",
    "% metrics of network activity: burst peak amplitude, inter-burst interval, burst \n",
    "% duration, and percentage of spikes within bursts. \n",
    "% \n",
